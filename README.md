# NBADataMiningProject
The goal of this project was to evaulate the uptick in 3-point shooting in the NBA and observe how it has changed the role of the center position. The typical center is often viewed as the biggest and strongest guy on the court, who plays near the hoop and collects rebounds. We observed the trend in 3-point shooting among centers and non-centers, and made predictions of the percentage of shots that will be 2-pointers and 3-pointers. We used two datasets, both from public repositories. We used the first to calculate trend in shot percentage from the 1980-81 season, which we used to calculate most of our graphs. The second dataset contains locations of all shots from the 2000-01 season, and an inner join was performed on the names of the players, which allows us to view the locations of shots of players and positions.
First Dataset: https://github.com/databyjp/learndata_nba/tree/master/data
Second Dataset + court image: https://theccalderon.github.io/2019/12/11/scrapping-shots-basketball-reference.html
Note: The court image is not entirely accurate, as there are 3-point shots that appear to be in front of the 3-point line, view
